RxJS = Reactive Extensions for JavaScript.

#### Signals vs RxJS:

**Signals**
- Contain state (variable values)
- Notify when that state changes
- React to those notifications
- Manage data after it has been retrieved + computed signals

**RxJS**
- Observe events or data that arrive over time (no state held)
- Notify when event occurs or data is emitted
- Reacts to those notifications - no values held, they are emitted over time.
- Good for HTTP GET/POST
- Retrieving and merging related sets of data
