### If

Same as always:

```
if (a > b) 
{
    Console.WriteLine("A is higher");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("B is higher");
}
```

---

### Ternary operators

```
string answer;
int a = 5;
int b = 10;

answer = (a > b) ? "A is higher" : "B is higher";

Console.WriteLine(answer);  // B is higher
```
