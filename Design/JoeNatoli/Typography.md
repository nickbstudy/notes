Use 2 different fonts **max**

Be generous with line spacing - 1.5x font height is good.

Aim for ~60 characters width on desktop, 30-40 on mobile

Don't forget to include plenty of paragraph breaks.  Giant blocks of text are bad and cause fatigue

Generally go for left aligned text, it's easier on the eyes to have a starting point to scan down and follow.
