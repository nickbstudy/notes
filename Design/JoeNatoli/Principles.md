#### Rhythm

Help users find a rhythm in your layout with **consistent visual intervals**.  This could be buttons in a row, headings above boxes in a form, picture/line/snippet picture/line/snippet kind of things.  Anything that repeats more than twice should continue in a good rhythm.

#### Harmony

Look for opportunities to echo spacing wherever possible.  Keep field spacing/titles consistent, or where there are anomalies look for other options to utilize that anomaly too.

#### Dominance

Emphasizing one or more elements to create an **entry point** in the design; a starting point from which you can lead the viewer to other parts of the screen.  Try to avoid having everything competing for dominance - have a hierarchy to direct user flow.

#### Alignment

Leading the eye across the screen is the most important visual design principle.  Utilize alignment as much as possible, and try to align everything with everything else

#### Proximity

Use proximity to group or separate visual elements.  It is a more powerful inidcator of grouping than contrast or anything else.

Use negative space to split different parts of a site, and keep related elements evenly and quite closely spaced.
