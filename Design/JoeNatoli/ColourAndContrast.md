Colour stirs emotional response and suggests associated meaning.  To prevent confusion in meaning, colour has to be used consistently, and appropriately.

It should *never* be the sole differentiator of things in the UI, it should only highlight and guide (due to colour blindness).

For extended screen situations, take pity on users and opt for light, muted background colours.  Bright colour should only be used for accents.

Are you using colour correctly?
- Are you using it sparingly?
- Does it reinforce or interfere with content?
- Is it used consistently?
- Is it **functional** or just decorative?
- Would this be just as functional for someone who's colour blind?

#### Building a palatte

(the example looked at an artistic photo)

- Shadows (darkest part)
- Midtones (slightly brighter)
- Highlights (lighter)
- Accents (different colour to stand out)

#### Contrast

Contrast draws attention to the essential components of the interface.  Highest constrast will draw the user first.  The core content or action should have the most contrast.
