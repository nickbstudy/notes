Make sure all images used serve a purpose.  Consider things like:

- Emotions evoked
- Messages sent
- How will it support/reinforce the content
- How will it guide/instruct
- Does it stregthen and deepen understanding or interfere/distract from it?


Focus on people (not things) - an image of somebody using something will carry more resonance.  Especially one of somebody looking away from the camera (so the viewer can be part of it)

Consider illustrations instead
