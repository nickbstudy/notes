- **Who** is the customer
- **What** is the problem you're trying to solve
- **Why** is it important to you to solve this problem

**Personas** - create a profile for the people you are developing for.  Find out what they do/don't like

Find and identifying opportunities.  The best information is gained from speaking to people.

#### Developing a strategy/roadmap ####

- **Theme** - the problem you're trying to solve.  Should be about the needs of the user, not features.
- **Epic** - A group of features with one common goal.  A theme will generally have several epics
- **Stories** - More granular than epics.  Details about how each feature will be implemented (API, data, options/permissions etc)
- **Features**

#### Product design ####

Try prototyping before building the entire product.  Get feedback and refine from there.

Do a beta test, maybe with surveys (1-5 instead of y/n questions)
