#### What makes a good product ####

- Great onboarding, support/guidance easily available.  Must be intuitive.
- Must solve a problem (find out exactly what problem you're trying to solve)
- User must quickly see value in the product, and have few barriers to understanding it
- Must have a professional, modern look.  User experience is very important.

#### What makes a bad product ####

- Not a unique product/improvement.  Needs to be better than competition.
- You shouldn't have to convince people it's a good product.
