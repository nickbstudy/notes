Most common types of tests:

- **Unit Tests** - Should have low complexity, be fast, and well encapsulated.
- **Integration Tests** - Checks whether or not two or more components work together correctly.  Medium complexity, relatively slow, not well encapsulated.  Used to check if changes result in failure.
- **Functional (end-to-end) Tests** - Test the full req/res cycle of an application.  High complexity, slow, badly encapsulated.

(MS TestHost & TestServer sometimes used?)

NSubstitute - good option instead of Moq
