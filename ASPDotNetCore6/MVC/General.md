MVC = Model View Controller.  

**Model:**
- Domain data & logic to manage data
- Simple API
- Hides details of managing the data

**View**

**Controller**

Models are like the 'nouns'.  Controller controls where it enters but not what is being seen.  Views are based off models
Keep in mind the distinction of 'list pages' and 'detail pages' - compared to a facebook feed vs a profile page`
