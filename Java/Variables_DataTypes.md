#Variables & Data Types

Java is statically typed.  They can be declared without a value. 

`private String firstName;`  
or  
`private String firstName = "Bob"`

### Primitive Types:

- String
- int (-2b to 2b)
- long (really big int)
- char (single character, initialize with 'single quote')
- byte
- float (put `f` after number)

Classes can be a data type - that creates an object.  Syntax is:  
`private Person tom = new Person()`

Constants can be declared with the 'final' keyword (convention is to name with all caps and underscore):  
`private final double PI = 3.14`
