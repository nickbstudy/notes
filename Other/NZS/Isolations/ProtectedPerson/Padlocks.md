## Padlocks
Only use Brady or Master Lock brands.

The 3 colours are:
- **Red** - Personal Lock
- **Yellow** - Equipment Lock
- **Green** - Group Lock

#### Red Locks
***Red locks have one key, use them to secure isolation before starting work***.  Your supervisor can issue a loan lock with a green & white ID tag attacked.

You must apply and remove your personal lock **yourself**.
Do not loan your personal lock.
**Remove** your personal lock when finished.

#### Yellow Equipment Lock
The yellow equipment lock secures an isolation point e.g. a valve or switch.  A protected person does **not** use a yellow lock.

#### Green Group Lock
The Isolation Leader secures the Group Board.  A protected person does **not** use a green lock.
