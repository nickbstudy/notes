Most important principle - eliminating waste

>If you aim at speed, you may get speed, but you'll get waste.  If you aim at the elimination of waste, you'll eliminate waste AND get speed.

**Write the test first, then the code to satisfy.**
The time spent fixing a bug after the fact is waste.  Human repetition is waste.

#### Defer commitment

Committing to something before beginning it can be dangerous.  It is not until you start a project that you truly understand where the difficulties may lie, and start to get a better idea of when it may be delivered.

#### Deliver fast

1. ***Deliver early*** (even just a mock) - this will help you get the pipeline set up, and facilitate valuable feedback rather than waiting until everything is in place and needs changing

2. ***Deliver often*** - Compare a quarterly to a weekly release schedule.  Weekly allows you to postpone features if they are not ready, then release as soon as they are.  Also working in a team, more merges means less conflicts.

#### The Seven Wastes

 - ***Partially done work***
 - ***Extra Features*** - Produced at the wrong time (that time may be never)
 - ***Relearning*** - Some forgetting or turnover is inevitable, create knowledge (or a simpler to comprehend design)
 - ***Handoffs***
 - ***Task Switching*** - People are not good multitaskers
 - ***Delays*** - Poor communication or commitments not met/deferred
 - ***Defects*** - Derails your work (inflicts the task-switching penalty too) - they can be a sign that you're not managing the other wastes.
